<h1>Crazydomains screwed me</h1>
<p>Unfortunately my entire site got deleted following an incident with phishing malware on my previous webserver.</p>
<p>This lead to an overreaction from my host which ultimately left me without access to my files, and subsequent loss of my website.</p>
<p>I tried to figure it out with them, but after my tickets go redirected to a useless member of their support team, I've opted to not renew my subscription and instead come to Git.</p>
<p>It'll be some time before I get around to making a site -mostly because I forget how to code- but fingers crossed this will be one of the last relocations for at least my home-page.</p>
